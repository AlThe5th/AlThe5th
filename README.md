**Howdy! Welcome to My GitHub :)** <br>
I’m an engineering research student at Texas Tech University with a deep passion for artificial intelligence (AI) and its development toward human cognitive levels, particularly in applications like mental health and therapy.

***About Me***<br>
I am actively building my expertise in machine learning and data science, combining hands-on experience with a focus on research. I'm currently collaborating with Dr. Uma Chinta on a project exploring binary classification and cancer data.<br>
<br>
Recently, I completed an impactful project at Relativity as part of the Break Through Tech's Fall AI Studio, where I assessed bias in frontier models applied to legal spaces/data.<br>
<br>
In addition to research, I am a hobbyist with a strong interest in exploring robotics, experimenting with circuits, and drafting designs in CAD., having worked on personal/club projects involving:
 * Raspberry Pi for web-based motor control using JavaScript
 * Arduino programming for mini-projects and laser-tag-enabled RC cars (client-server communication)
<br>

***Skills & Technologies***<br>
Programming Languages: Python, C, C++, Arduino, JavaScript<br>
AI/ML Libraries: TensorFlow, scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy<br>
Tools: Gemini API, Jupyter Notebooks, CAD software<br>
<br>
***Projects***<br>
[Bias Assessment of Legal Data in AI for Relativity](https://github.com/relativity-1c/relativity-1c/tree/main)<br>
Analyzed fairness and bias in frontier AI models for legal applications to promote ethical AI practices.<br>
<br>
***Future Goals***<br>
Within the next decade, I aspire to earn a Ph.D. in Computer Science, focusing on AI research and development while advancing capabilities in AI for impactful real-world applications.<br>
